//threads in this program could stip at one step if the low level system accept bits from cpu.
//then the usb key would have a long range hash lets say 10^17 or 10^15 digits. but the main problem is still
//the short number of rainbow attack equations parametere.
//as an engineerin result, we would better have oarc model expansion parametere.
//the latent space could be then fullfilled with variational methods which allow matlab to be used.
